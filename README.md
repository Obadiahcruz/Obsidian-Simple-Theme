# Obsidian-Simple-Theme
This is a theme made for the note taking program called Obsidian. 

- eliminates some non-important markdown such as bold and italics.
- hides all bars and icons to allow a non-intrusive experience. 
- colorful headers
- Simple.

> known issue: When trying to move multiple page windows around, you could get confused since it uses same scheme background color. Will try to have it fixed at a later time.

#### Who Created This?
- Even though i created this theme, it is a compilation of all of the found tweaks(hacks) that were made by various users in the obsidian forum. Thanks to all of them that this project was made possible. P.S. i would name them but they are too many to name and i forgot how many i used
